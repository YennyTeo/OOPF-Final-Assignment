# OOPF-Final-Assignment
You are required to develop a simple subject enrolment system for Sunway University. The system should be able to store the information of the students, lecturers, and the subjects they enrolled or teach. Each subject can be enrolled by multiple students and only taught by one lecturer.

The system needs to store the appropriate information to allow an attendance report to be generated for a particular subject, including the subject code, the information of the students who have enrolled to the subject, such as the name, address, the programme they registered and their year of intake. And, the lecturer information which includes the lecturer’s name, address, school/department they belong to.

The Finance department would also like to use the system for their reporting; hence it should be developed to be able to keep track of the fee that the student needs to pay and the lecturer’s salary. The lecturer who stays in Selangor (staff’s address contains “Selangor”), will be given an additional 200 allowances. (note: you can use the contains() method from the String library)

a) Identify and design the classes that fulfill the above requirements by drawing the UML class relationship diagram with required data members. You should design your classes for optimum maintainability and reusability with the best practices of object-oriented techniques you have learnt. Use inheritance whenever appropriate.

b) Develop the classes that you’ve designed in part 1(a) in Java language. Complete the classes with appropriate constructors, methods, setters and getters.

c) Develop a driver class (main application) to demonstrate the creation of a subject with the code “PRG1203” which is enrolled by Three(3) students “Ahmad”, “John” and “Mindy” and taught by One(1) lecturer “Dr. Tan”. Print out the information of all students and lecture for this subject with the use of an ArrayList.
